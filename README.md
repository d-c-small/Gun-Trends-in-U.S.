# Gun Trends in the United States.
Investigated gun registration trends in the U.S. between (1999-2016).
## Introduction

Gun ownership and the use of firearms has become an ongoing debate in the United States. In the last few years, mass shootings have persuaded people to push for stricter gun laws throughout the country. Between (1999-2016) have background checks for gun registrations decreased or increased? What do the gun trends look like in each state and which ones have the most and least gun registration growth? Finally, are there any factors associated with higher gun registrations per capita based on census data? 

This data will investigate gun registrations using the [U.S. Census Data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a0a554c_u.s.-census-data/u.s.-census-data.csv&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1664580025057728&usg=AOvVaw1slpDgPRWt5B4GRqctBk0-) and the [FBI's Gun Data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a0a4db8_gun-data/gun-data.xlsx&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1664580025057165&usg=AOvVaw1wWw7yeP4NA3cv1gmxe_k8). The FBI's gun data comes from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Original source can be found on [Github](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks/blob/master/README.md&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1664580025055946&usg=AOvVaw3kp7EnqBt_l3Xs7U0FvQ1Z).

There are a few limitations to this data. One of the most important limitations to take into consideration is that the data from the NCIS is in regards to the number of background checks initiated and not firearms sold. Some examples of this include, a background check being conducted for a concealed carry permit or a state conducting multiple background checks, over a span of time on a single person, to ensure continued eligibility to conceal carry. The state of Kentucky is known for conducting background checks on a single person, every year, to ensure eligibility to conceal carry. Therefore, no correlation can be made between background checks conducted and firearms sold.
